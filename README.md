Emotion Recognition in videos using RetinaFace and DeepFace.

Emotion Detection from Video
This project is a Dockerized Flask application that detects emotions from faces in a video using RetinaFace for face detection and DeepFace for emotion analysis. The application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading videos and displays detailed statistics about the detected emotions. Additionally, it includes generative AI components to enhance emotion detection or generate synthetic data for training.

Features

Video Upload: Users can upload video files through a web interface.
Face Detection: Uses RetinaFace to detect faces in each frame of the video.
Emotion Analysis: Uses DeepFace to analyze emotions for each detected face.
Statistics Generation: Generates detailed statistics for each face, including:
Count of all emotions.
Most common emotion.
Average confidence for each emotion.
Total frames processed.
Probabilistic embeddings shape.
Example embedding (first frame).
JSON Output: Saves statistics and embeddings in JSON files for further analysis.
Generative AI Components: Uses generative models to enhance emotion detection or generate synthetic data.
Dockerized: The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
Libraries Used

Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python used to create the backend API and serve the frontend.
OpenCV: Used for video processing and frame extraction.
RetinaFace: A state-of-the-art face detection model for accurately detecting faces in video frames.
DeepFace: A deep learning-based facial analysis library used for emotion detection.
NumPy: Used for numerical computations and handling arrays.
Hugging Face Transformers: For integrating generative AI models like GPT or Stable Diffusion.
Docker: Used to containerize the application for easy deployment and scalability.

Setup and Installation

Prerequisites

Docker: Install Docker from here.
Python: Install Python 3.9 or later from here.
Steps

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection-app.git
cd emotion-detection-app
Install Python dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Build the Docker image:
bash
Copy
docker build -t emotion-detection-app .
Running the Application

Using Docker

Run the Docker container:
bash
Copy
docker run -p 5000:5000 emotion-detection-app
Access the application at http://localhost:5000.
Without Docker

Run the Flask application:
bash
Copy
python app/app.py
Access the application at http://localhost:5000.
How It Works

Video Upload: The user uploads a video file through the web interface.
Frame Extraction: The application processes the video frame by frame.
Face Detection: RetinaFace detects faces in each frame.
Emotion Analysis: DeepFace analyzes emotions for each detected face.
Statistics Generation: The application generates statistics for each face and saves them in JSON files.
Generative AI Enhancement: Generative AI models are used to enhance emotion detection or generate synthetic data.
Display Results: The statistics are displayed on the web interface.
Generative AI Components

The generative AI component of the project is implemented using Hugging Face Transformers and other generative models. It can be used for two main purposes:

1. Enhancing Emotion Detection

Objective: Use generative models to improve the accuracy of emotion detection by generating additional training data or refining predictions.
Process:
Use a generative model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) to create synthetic facial expressions for underrepresented emotions.
Fine-tune the emotion detection model using the synthetic data.
2. Generating Synthetic Data

Objective: Generate synthetic facial expressions to augment the training dataset for the emotion detection model.
Process:
Use a generative model to create diverse facial expressions with different emotions.
Combine synthetic data with real data to train a more robust emotion detection model.
Example Code (utils/generative_ai.py)

python
Copy
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a generative model (e.g., Stable Diffusion)
generator = pipeline("text-to-image", model="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2")

# Generate synthetic facial expressions
def generate_synthetic_face(emotion):
    prompt = f"A realistic face showing {emotion} emotion"
    synthetic_image = generator(prompt)
    return synthetic_image

# Example usage
synthetic_face = generate_synthetic_face("happiness")
synthetic_face.save("synthetic_happiness.png")
API Endpoints

GET /: Renders the main UI for uploading videos.
POST /upload: Accepts a video file and processes it for emotion detection.
GET /stats/<filename>: Returns the statistics for a processed video.
Frontend UI

The frontend is a simple HTML page with the following features:

File Upload: Users can upload video files.
Statistics Display: Displays the generated statistics in a readable format.
Dockerization

The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment. The Dockerfile includes:

A base Python 3.9 image.
Installation of dependencies from requirements.txt.
Exposing port 5000 for the Flask application.
Running the Flask app on container startup.
